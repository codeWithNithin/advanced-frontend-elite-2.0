# Setup first HTML file, HTML tags, self closing tags

- code editor: VS code
- what is the use of extension (ex: .js, .html)
- it just tell the OS, what is the meaning of this file, which software is compatible to open, what night be the content.

# create a HTML file

- extension will be .html
- file name is given as index.
- plain text is not the recomended way.

# tags

- a simple mechanism using which we can tell, what is this part of doc. actually meaning.
- format
- <tagname> content </tagname>
- <tagname> -> opening tag
- </tagname> -> closing tag
- in between opening and closing tag we keep some info
- few tags called as self closing tags, they dont need a seperate closing tag.
- format <tagname />
- here opening and closing is managed by the same tag.

# to check the HTML doc

- in file browser, go to that index.html and click on it to open it on browser.

# elements

- Heading (h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6): to put heading in HTML DOC
- paragraph (p) -> to put paragraph in HTML
- lists (ol, ul) -> to list some contents in bullets or using numbers.
  -- 2 types of lists:
  --- 1. ordered list (ol)
  --- ex: 1. HTML 2. CSS 3. JS 4. ReactJS
  --- 2. unordered list (ul)
  --- ex: listing will be done with bullets.
- image (img)
  -- this is not the only way to display images, we can also do it using JS and CSS

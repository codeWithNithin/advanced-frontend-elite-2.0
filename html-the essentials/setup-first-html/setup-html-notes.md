# tags

- a simple mechanism using which we can tell, what is this part of doc. actually meaning.
- format
- <tagname> content </tagname>
- <tagname> -> opening tag
- </tagname> -> closing tag

- few tags called as self closing tags, they dont need a seperate closing tag.
- format <tagname />
- here opening and closing is managed by the same tag.

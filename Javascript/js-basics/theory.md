# JS Basics

## Intro to programming with JS

# Javascript

- Its a very vast language.
- It demands dedication.
- Dont expect to become master in 1 day.
- Its a multi paradigm, programming language.
- Any piece of software we are building we need to store it some information.
  -- for ex: tic-tac-toe. where some info, like computer position marked and user postion marked.
- program in a running state is called process

# keywords

- In a programming language, few words are reserved by the language for it own purpose. we cant change the meaning and re-purpose them for a different use case.

# How can we store some values inside a programming language.

- To store values, we can use variables.
- ex: we can think of variables as a bucket with name on it and inside that bucket, we have a value.

# Coding variables in JS

- to create a file in JS, we use .js extension

# How to create a variable in JavaScript ?

- There are 3 ways to create variables
- using var keyword.
  -- syntax - var <variablename> = <value>
- using let keyword.
  -- syntax - let <variablename> = <value>
- using const keyword.
  -- syntax - const <variablename> = <value>
- code is already there in variablesdemo.js file

## semicolons

- one line in js code, is equivalent to 1 line instruction that we want to give to computer.
- one complete instruction is called a statement.
- In JS, we can put semicolon, but its optional.
- Its recomended to add ; so when someone reads it, they are able to distinguish 2 statements.

## rules for naming a variables

- variables can contain, alphabets (small, caps), along with numbers and \_ and $ as special characters.
- we cannot have space, and any other special characters.
- We should give, meaningful names properly.
- Name,cant start with digits, but it can have digits in between or at last.
- we cant use keywords as variables.

## functions as black box

- a function, can take input, processes it some how, and gives you the output.
- first function, that JS gives is console.log().
- if there are 2 diff. console logs are there, then outputs are printed in diffrent lines.
- We can also pass, multiple values together to console.log() and all of them will be on same line.
- ex: code are written in consolelogdemo.js file

## Datatypes in JS.

- values in JS can either be primitive or non-primitive (object)
- primitive datatypes are -> types which are atomic in nature
- number - ex: 10, -3, 2.6, 3.414
- string - 'random text' or 'Random Text' or `Random Text`
- boolean - true and false
- undefined - a variable that is declared but value is not yet assigned.
- null - a explicit value, that can be assigned to a variable.
- symbol

- non primitve datatypes are -> types
- functions
- arrays
- date object
- object literals

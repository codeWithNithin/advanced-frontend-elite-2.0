# components

- we can create components using js functions
- we can use dry priniciple.
- we can reuse it how much time i want to.
- its just a function which is returning jsx ie in turn converted to react element which will be then converted to js object which will help us to render it as an html element.
- conversion of JSX to js will be done by transpiler.
- when creating components, we only return how the ui looks like.
- jsx is html like code along with js.
- jsx - javascript xml
- component's first name should be capital.
- we can use moduling in react to seperate logics as well, like 1 component per file.
- to use any component, we can export and import it.
- in default export, name doesnt matter you can give any name while importing
- you dont have to give the name for default export.
